# Student Performance Analysis Dashboard

This project analyzes student academic performance data focusing on marks and attendance. It uses Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to clean data, perform exploratory analysis, and create insightful visualizations.

## Features

- Calculates average marks per subject and identifies top performers.
- Visualizes individual student marks with color-coded bar charts.
- Filters students with attendance below 75% to identify those at risk.
- Analyzes the correlation between attendance and marks.
- Input-driven graphs to view performance of specific students.
- Developed entirely in Google Colab for easy sharing and collaboration.

## Technologies Used

- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Google Colab
- CSV for data storage

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Upload `students.csv` dataset or use the provided one.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) in Google Colab or locally.
4. Run the notebook cells to perform analysis and generate visualizations.
5. Enter student names when prompted to view individual performance charts.

## Repository Structure

- `students.csv` — Dataset containing student names, marks, and attendance.
- `analysis.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with code for data analysis and visualization.
- `README.md` — This file.
